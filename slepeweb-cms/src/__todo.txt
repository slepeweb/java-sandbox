TODO: This is the main todo file:

HIGH
- MediaFileService contains canned data + explicit references to 'pho' !!!
- isolate trash can - too close to search control.
- restoring the entire trash bin does not update the left nav - refresh page?
- trashing all flagged items: controller doesn't return a RestResponse, so undo/redo status not getting updated.
- implement cron job to backup cms db on desktop
- enhancement: move flagged items to the same location

MEDIUM
- Thumbnails sometimes have wrong orientation - will take a lot of work to rectify. See ImageUtil.
- re-test registration process
- force media items to have appropriate simplename extensions, esp. video, pdf, etc. (???)
- PDFs not viewable on my android phone (chrome)
- PDFs not rendered with scrollbars on iPad
- need to protect against injection attacks
- store preferred language in cookie (Ancestry)
- resource bundles (Ancestry)
- documents need to be nest-able (Ancestry)
- also, solr indexing needs to recognise nesting nature

LOW
- app to remove redundant media files from file store
- write test: cannot move item to one of it's children, OR descendants
- write test: cannot move item to one of it's linked parents (ie via relations, inlines, etc)
