HIGH



MEDIUM
- anc login ui should display error messages in red, just like glj now does
- anc site is not displaying images - I believe this is due to the move towards storing images as 
- --files instead of db blobs. All images on anc will need to be re-created manually.
- When an item is inaccessible in cms-e, the delete icon in the header should also be disabled
- Thumbnails sometimes have wrong orientation - will take a lot of work to rectify. See ImageUtil.
- re-test registration process (anc)
- store preferred language in cookie (Ancestry)

LOW
- Is there a case to update item ownership in bulk?
- app to remove redundant media files from file store
- write test: cannot move item to one of it's children, OR descendants
- write test: cannot move item to one of it's linked parents (ie via relations, inlines, etc)
- force media items to have appropriate simplename extensions, esp. video, pdf, etc. (???)
- PDFs not viewable on my android phone (chrome)
- PDFs not rendered with scrollbars on iPad
- need to protect against injection attacks
- resource bundles (Ancestry)
- documents need to be nest-able (Ancestry)
- also, solr indexing needs to recognise nesting nature
