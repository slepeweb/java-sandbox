			<h3>The computing environment</h3>
			<p>
				This website is being served by an Amazon EC2 virtual server, 
				running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Installed on this server are: Java 1.6, Tomcat 7, Apache 2.2 and MongoDB. The
				database is being used to store login account details, with the Jasypt library being used to encrypt 
				passwords.</p>
				
			<p>
				The website design was originated by n33.co, and is a responsive design based on skelJS. jQuery coding
				has been added to provide user-friendly layouts and to handle Ajax calls.</p>

			<h3>Lottery numbers service</h3>
			<p>
				The lottery numbers below are generated by a web service (REST) that
				is hosted on this server. The web service uses the Jersey
				implementation of JAX-RS. An ajax request is made to retrieve the JSON
				representation of this resource: <a href="/rest/lottery/numbers/3">Call
					service</a> for alternative XML representation ...

			<h3>Password generation service</h3>
			
			<p>
				Enter a seed string that identifies the company/website that the password is for,
				then click on the 'Get password' button.
			</p>
			
			<table class="two-col-table">
				<tr>
					<td class="heading"><label for="org">Seed</label></td>
					<td><input id="password-org" type="text" name="org" size="32" /></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="heading"><label for="password">Password</label></td>
					<td><input id="password-pwd" type="text" name="password" size="32" /></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<br />
			<button type="button" class="button" id="password-update">Get password</button>

			<p style="margin-top: 20px">
				This triggers an ajax request that calls a RESTful service, that in turn calls a 
				SOAP service. Both services are hosted on this server.
				The SOAP service digests the seed, generates a corresponding password, and returns that
				to the RESTful service, which returns a JSON object to the Ajax caller.
