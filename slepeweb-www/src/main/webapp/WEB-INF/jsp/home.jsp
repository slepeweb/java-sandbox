	<h2>About us</h2>

	<p>With an impressive track record of building dynamic websites for
		some well-known clients, Slepe Web Solutions (SWS) offers java web
		application development expertise to systems integrators. Whilst its
		main strengths are in back-end java web technologies, SWS also offers
		a sound understanding of the corresponding front-end technologies,
		which is important for integrating the two parts.</p>

	<p>Another key strength of SWS is the depth of experience in
		designing and building CMS-driven websites, primarily with the
		Alterian product. A good CMS design means feature-rich web pages,
		efficient content storage, easy updates for business users, and
		performant multi-channel content delivery.</p>
